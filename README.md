My repository where I practice and study data structures and design algoriths with good practices and advances methods using Python3

- Arrays
    - First Duplicate Element
    - First Not Repeating Character
    - Rotate a Matrix
- Strings
    - Valid IP Addresses
- Linked List
    - Linked List Constructor

    - Remove K element from end
- Queus and Stacks
    - Max Stack Contructor 
- Recursion
    - Fibonacci 
    -  Reverse Parentesis
- Sorting Algorithms

## For testing the code

Create a virtual environment and install the pytest librarie using

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And just run the following command on the project root
