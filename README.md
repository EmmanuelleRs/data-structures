# Data Structures

My repository where I practice and study data structures and design algoriths with good practices and advances methods using Python3

    - First Duplicate Element
    - First Not Repeating Character
    - Rotate a Matrix
- Strings
    - Valid IP Addresses
    - Group Words By Anagrams
    - Is Palindrome
    - Min characters  For creating Words
- Linked List
    - Linked List Constructor
    - Remove K element
    - Remove K element from end
    - Reverse a LinkedList
    - Palindromic LinkedList
- Queus and Stacks
    - Max Stack Contructor 
- Recursion
    - Fibonacci 
    - Special Array Sum
    - Reverse a Parentesis
- Dynamic Programming
    -  Reverse Parentesis
    - Fibonacci
- Sorting Algorithms
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Selection


## For testing the code

Create a virtual environment and install the pytest librarie using

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And just run the following command on the project root

```bash
